discoveringbirdsong
===================

Discovering birdsong is a project using the amazing audio archive at [xeno-canto](http://xeno-canto.org/ "Title") 
It is an attempt to use simple techniques of bayesian inference to power a recommendation engine for the catalog of bird calls at Xeno-Canto.  
Powered by Python, Django, Numpy, and Scipy.  And probably alot more.  read the reqs.  


Many, many warm thanks to Jonathon Jongsma, William-Pier Vellinga and Bob Planque for donating their time and data to help make this possible.
